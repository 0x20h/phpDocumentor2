0.7: Enhance docblock support and add support for multiple writers
* Revisit template and make it prettier
* Add parsing of docblock annotations and adding specific functionality per annotation
* Add support for subpackages

0.8: Fix known issues
* Add docblocks to DocBlox
* Class docblocks are also used as file docblocks when generating the new theme.
* Large complex applications generate a large sidebar in the new theme; this should be solved for ZF2
* Revisit namespace support to check for consistency
* Add support for the T_USE token
* Zend_Reflection_DocBlock does not correctly parse docblocks. It sometimes fail to see the diff between a short and
  long description.
* Add inline parsing of annotations in docblock descriptions (see /lib/Zend/Log/Formatter/Firebug.php:40 for an example)

0.9: Add custom documents, statistics and improve theming
* Add statistics (nr of files, classes, methods, with or without docblock. Percentage, lines per method, lines per file, configurable thresholds, etc)
* Keep track of number of docblock successes and fails and show at the end of the process
* Check theming support and improve
* Add theme.xml config file to themes; this can provide information what writer to use for a theme
* Add PDF output writer
* Add Twig output writer
* add possibility for README, INSTALL, TODO in markdown format
* add possibility for custom documents in markdown format
* add Markdown support in long descriptions and @example (thanks @pmjones)
* Syntax highlight @example annotation content

0.10: Pre 1.0 cleanup
* safari does not show the svg nicely, it places it into a very small scrollbox
* Refactor static reflection to return contents in a different way and change the way XML is handled
