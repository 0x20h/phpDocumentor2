0.8: Fix known issues
* Large complex applications generate a large sidebar in the new theme; this should be solved for ZF2
* Revisit namespace support to check for consistency
* array notation is seen as a 'type', the [] should not be evaluated (i.e. string[] becomes \namespace\string[])
* Add inline parsing of annotations in docblock descriptions (see /lib/Zend/Log/Formatter/Firebug.php:40 for an example)
* Keep track of number of docblock successes and fails and show at the end of the process

0.9: Improve Theming and CLI
* Check theming support and improve
* Add PDF output writer
* Add Twig output writer
* Create a single executable (docblox.php) frontend for parse and transform; refactor Argument.php to cli.php and to
  allow it to work for all three executables.

0.10: Add custom documents, statistics and improve theming
* Add statistics (nr of files, classes, methods, with or without docblock. Percentage, lines per method, lines per file, configurable thresholds, etc)
* Add theme.xml config file to themes; this can provide information what writer to use for a theme
* add possibility for README, INSTALL, TODO in markdown format
* add possibility for custom documents in markdown format
* add Markdown support in long descriptions and @example (thanks @pmjones)
* Syntax highlight @example annotation content

0.11: Pre 1.0 cleanup
* safari does not show the svg nicely, it places it into a very small scrollbox
* Refactor static reflection to return contents in a different way and change the way XML is handled
* Revisit template and make it prettier

BONUS:
* UML Class Diagram

Technical Debt:
* Add docblocks to DocBlox
* Add documentation
* Write unit tests

More items will be added to this list as the project furthers.
