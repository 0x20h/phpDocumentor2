0.7: Enhance docblock support and add support for multiple writers
* Closures break the parser, DocBlox_Reflection_Function::findName assumes to find one but closures do not have a name
* investigate search performance on bigger projects
* add links to other classes with the @param and @return annotation information
* add parsing of docblock annotations and adding specific functionality per annotation
* syntax highlight @example annotation content
* add inline parsing of annotations in docblock descriptions (see /lib/Zend/Log/Formatter/Firebug.php:40 for an example)
* Add PDF output writer
* Zend_Reflection_DocBlock does not correctly parse docblocks. It sometimes fail to see the diff between a short and
  long description.

0.8: Add custom documents, statistics and improve theming
* Add statistics (nr of files, classes, methods, with or without docblock. Percentage, lines per method, lines per file, configurable thresholds, etc)
* Keep track of number of docblock successes and fails and show at the end of the process
* Check theming support and improve
* add possibility for README, INSTALL, TODO in markdown format
* add possibility for custom documents in markdown format

0.9: Pre 1.0 cleanup
* safari does not show the svg nicely, it places it into a very small scrollbox
* revisit template and make it prettier
