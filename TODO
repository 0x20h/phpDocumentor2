0.9: Improve Theming and CLI
* Create a task to do both parse and transform
* Update the tasks to have their long description in the class docblock.
* restore search in new templates
* Links do not detect | notation; they just ignore them
* @see tags which define methods (<class>::<method>) are not converted into a link
* @throw tags exception class is not converted to a link
* Add option to disable certain types of DocBlox errors (i.e. check on file-level docblock; constant level docblock; etc)
* Links in the XSLT writer's output do not work with sub-directories; need to change this
* include section should be clickable (click-through)
* Click-through on classes in parameter tags leads to the right file but without anchor
* Add PDF output writer using ezPDF|TCPDF|FPDF|DocBook|html2pdf (http://www.tufat.com/s_html2ps_html2pdf.htm)?
* Add Twig output writer

0.10: Add custom documents and statistics
* Add statistics (nr of files, classes, methods, with or without docblock. Percentage, lines per method, lines per file, configurable thresholds, etc)
* add possibility for README, INSTALL, TODO in markdown format
* add possibility for custom documents in markdown format
* add Markdown support in long descriptions and @example (thanks @pmjones)
* Syntax highlight @example annotation content
* Consider implementing disqus support

0.11: Pre 1.0 cleanup
* safari does not show the svg nicely, it places it into a very small scrollbox
* Add docblox templates: http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocumentor/tutorial_phpDocumentor.howto.pkg.html#basics.docblocktemplate

 BONUS:
* UML Class Diagram

Technical Debt:
* Add docblocks to DocBlox
* Add documentation
* Write unit tests
* Refactor static reflection to:
  * Be uniform with the Reflector interface and PHP's Dynamic Reflection
  * Consistently use either DOMDocument or SimpleXMLElement

More items will be added to this list as the project furthers.
