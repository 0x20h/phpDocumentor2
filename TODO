0.9: Improve Theming and CLI
* Large complex applications generate a large sidebar in the new theme; this should be solved for ZF2
* Add PDF output writer using ezPDF
* Add Twig output writer
* Create a single executable (docblox.php) frontend for parse and transform; refactor Argument.php to cli.php and to
  allow it to work for all three executables.
* Add option to disable certain types of DocBlox errors (i.e. check on file-level docblock; constant level docblock; etc)
* Links do not detect | notation; they just ignore them
* @see tags which define methods (<class>::<method>) are not converted into a link
* @throw tags exception class is not converted to a link
* The file output can not be put in a sub-directory; need to change this

0.10: Add custom documents, statistics and improve theming
* Add statistics (nr of files, classes, methods, with or without docblock. Percentage, lines per method, lines per file, configurable thresholds, etc)
* Add theme.xml config file to themes; this can provide information what writer to use for a theme
* add possibility for README, INSTALL, TODO in markdown format
* add possibility for custom documents in markdown format
* add Markdown support in long descriptions and @example (thanks @pmjones)
* Syntax highlight @example annotation content

0.11: Pre 1.0 cleanup
* safari does not show the svg nicely, it places it into a very small scrollbox
* Refactor static reflection to:
  * Be uniform with the Reflector interface and PHP's Dynamic Reflection
  * Consistently use either DOMDocument or SimpleXMLElement
* Add docblox templates: http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocumentor/tutorial_phpDocumentor.howto.pkg.html#basics.docblocktemplate

 BONUS:
* UML Class Diagram

Technical Debt:
* Add docblocks to DocBlox
* Add documentation
* Write unit tests

More items will be added to this list as the project furthers.
