01/04/2012: Version 2.0.0
--------------------------

* CHANGED: #380, The regex that strips the docblock from the cruft (asterisks)
           did not remove any tabs that happened directly after the asterisk.
           This is now added to perform a cleaner stripping and prevent any
           issues from unexpected whitespace.
* FIXED:   #398, Interfaces were not inherited correctly
* CHANGED: Several documentation improvements
