Building your own branding
==========================

Developing your own branding consists of two steps:

  1. Creating a theme
  2. Creating a template

Most of the time it is only necessary to replace the graphical layout with that of your own project.
This is an easy process and requires little explanation on how theming and templating actually works.
Please consult the chapter _Quick version_ when the above is what you desire.

Do you want to control every detail of how your template looks then it is recommended to read the chapter
_Elaborate version_; this will provide more theory on how branding works in DocBlox.
