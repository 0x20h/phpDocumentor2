Roadmap
=======

0.9: Improve Theming and CLI
----------------------------

* Add PDF output writer using ezPDF|TCPDF|FPDF|DocBook|html2pdf (http://www.tufat.com/s_html2ps_html2pdf.htm)?
* @param, @var and @return only support 1 variable, not separated with |; this should change and meta data should be
  generated accordingly
* Add small class diagram in class description showing all parents (and their parents) and direct children, preferably clickable
* include section should be clickable (click-through)
* Research: create template that somehow has the frames page in the no Javascript section and have navigation fully offloaded to ajax

0.10: Add custom documents and statistics
-----------------------------------------

* add possibility for README, INSTALL, TODO in markdown format
* add possibility for custom documents in markdown format
* add mime-type option to long-description so that the transformation could change it into the required type: i.e. markdown = text/x-markdown
  * add Markdown support in long descriptions and @example (thanks @pmjones)
* Syntax highlight @example annotation content
* Add option to disable certain types of DocBlox errors (i.e. check on file-level docblock; constant level docblock; etc)
* Safari does not show the svg nicely, it places it into a very small scrollbox

1.1
---

* Add Docblock templates: http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocumentor/tutorial_phpDocumentor.howto.pkg.html#basics.docblocktemplate
* Consider implementing disqus support
* Add Twig output writer
* Add statistics (nr of files, classes, methods, with or without docblock. Percentage, lines per method, lines per file, configurable thresholds, etc)
* Research: allow connections between multiple docblox generated files?
* UML Class Diagram

The Future
----------

* Refactor XSL templates to
  * Clean them up
  * Separate them further into distinct files
  * Allow for more modularity and easier templating by just including a header or so
* Refactor Static Reflection to
  * Be uniform with the Reflector interface and PHP's Dynamic Reflection
  * Move XML creation to the Parser
* Create an XSD for the structure file

Technical Debt
--------------

* Add docblocks to DocBlox
* Add documentation
* Write unit tests

**More items will be added to this list as the project furthers.**
