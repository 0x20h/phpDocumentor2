0.9: Improve Theming and CLI
* Add option to disable certain types of DocBlox errors (i.e. check on file-level docblock; constant level docblock; etc)
* Links in the XSLT writer's output do not work with sub-directories; need to change this
* Create a task to do both parse and transform
* Add PDF output writer using ezPDF|TCPDF|FPDF|DocBook|html2pdf (http://www.tufat.com/s_html2ps_html2pdf.htm)?
* @param, @var and @return only support 1 variable, not separated with |; this should change and meta data should be
  generated accordingly
* Add small class diagram in class description showing all parents (and their parents) and direct children, preferably clickable
* include section should be clickable (click-through)
* Research: create template that somehow has the frames page in the no Javascript section and have navigation fully offloaded to ajax

0.10: Add custom documents and statistics
* add possibility for README, INSTALL, TODO in markdown format
* add possibility for custom documents in markdown format
* add mime-type option to long-description so that the transformation could change it into the required type: i.e. markdown = text/x-markdown
  * add Markdown support in long descriptions and @example (thanks @pmjones)
* Syntax highlight @example annotation content

0.11: Pre 1.0 cleanup
* safari does not show the svg nicely, it places it into a very small scrollbox

1.1
* Add docblox templates: http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocumentor/tutorial_phpDocumentor.howto.pkg.html#basics.docblocktemplate
* Consider implementing disqus support
* Add Twig output writer
* Add statistics (nr of files, classes, methods, with or without docblock. Percentage, lines per method, lines per file, configurable thresholds, etc)
* Research: allow connections between multiple docblox generated files?

BONUS:
* UML Class Diagram

Technical Debt:
* Add docblocks to DocBlox
* Add documentation
* Write unit tests
* Refactor static reflection to:
  * Be uniform with the Reflector interface and PHP's Dynamic Reflection
  * Consistently use either DOMDocument or SimpleXMLElement

More items will be added to this list as the project furthers.
