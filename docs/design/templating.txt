Theming
=======

Effectively a theme is a combination of rules which lead to a generated set of artifacts.

Theme:
  Action:
    TODO
  Rule:
    writer:       the writer to apply for this rule, may be XSLT, Graph, etc
    query:        a query string identifying the set of data to use in the template, may result in an array. The query
                  language is dependant on the chosen writer
    template:     a string identifying what to generate; this may be an actual file template or type identifier
                  (for a graph type for example)
    destination:  the destination location; must be able to contain variables in case the query has provided an array
