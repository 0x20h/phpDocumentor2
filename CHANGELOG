xx/xx/xxxx: Version 0.7: Enhance docblock support and add support for multiple writers
---------------------

* FIXED:    Generated paths where set absolute to the file system preventing the running of generated output in a webserver
* FIXED:    Namespaces where not included in the extend and implement xml nodes
* FIXED:    Class hierarchy chart entered an endless recursion if a class extended another class with the same name in a different namespace
* FIXED:    Closures break the parser, DocBlox_Reflection_Function::findName assumes to find one but closures do not have a name. CLosures receive the name 'Closure'
* ADDED:    Line numbers to all objects in the xml output
* ADDED:    Add links to other classes with the @param and @return annotation information
* FIXED:    Namespace support was not converting local class notation to a full_name class notation (including namespaces)
* FIXED:    Namespace was not registered with anything else other than a file, class or interface
* ADDED:    Property @var tag also links to other files
* ADDED:    AJAX search box for larger projects, use the option '--search=Ajax' with the transformer to use it
* ADDED:    NONE search option to disable the search action, use the option '--search=None' with the transformer to use it
* ADDED:    New theme
* FIXED:    Theming did not support different XSL files per theme. this has now been fixed
* BC-BREAK: Namespaces and their sub-spaces are now stored hierarchically at the bottom of the XML file, this used to
            be a flat list
* ADDED:    Themes can now preprocess XSL templates present in the 'preprocess' folder and store them in memory to
            speed up parsing of seldom changing data
* FIXED:    variables in methods were recognized as properties when enclosed in accolades (thanks for noticing @pmjones)
* FIXED:    Improved performance by changing hash from md5 to filemtime (thanks to @pmjones for this tip!)
* ADDED:    Recognition of file character encoding and conversion to UTF-8 (thanks to @dzuelke)
* FIXED:    Improved performance by disabling the PHP Lint check by default; can be enabled using the --validate option
* ADDED:    Make packages foldable as i done with namespaces (no support for subpackages yet!) (thanks to @pmjones)
* FIXED:    Support for Unicode characters in @author annotations
* FIXED:    The generation of filenames for the transformation process produced the wrong names on Windows. A '/' was
            hardcoded while this should have been a DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR
* ADDED:    Version to parsed data (structure.xml) and enforce a full re-parse when the version number has changed
* ADDED:    Added support for the @subpackage in the sidebar of the default2 theme
