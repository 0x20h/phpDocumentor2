--/--/----: Version 0.8L fix known issues

* ADDED:    Support for array notation of types (i.e. string[] or MyClass[])
* ADDED:    Support for the T_USE token (namespace aliasing)
* FIXED:    PHP 5.2.6 compatibility was restored; changed in the previous versions broke this
* FIXED:    Improved file character encoding methods; using forward compatibility (uses finfo when available)
* FIXED:    renamed config.xml to doctrine.config.xml to help Jenkins config
* FIXED:    transformer now also checks the version of DocBlox vs. the structure.xml; if  it differs you need to
            regenerate your structure.xml
* FIXED:    DocBlox no longer tries to find the log directory in the working directory but in the DocBlox root
* FIXED:    Replaced Zend_Reflector_DocBlock with a new DocBlox_Reflector_DocBlock set of classes, this fixes
            among others the following issues:
            - Multi-line short descriptions were not possible
            - Short descriptions now end if a closing dot is encountered (dot not in a word)
            - Multi-line tags are now possible
            - Correct handling of unicode characters in tags
* FIXED:    Bodyless methods (abstract or interface) kept searching for an opening brace and thus took the braces of
            the next structure. Now the code recognizes bodyless methods and skips trying to find a body.

01/02/2011: Version 0.7: Enhance docblock support, add new template and improve theming
---------------------

* FIXED:    Generated paths where set absolute to the file system preventing the running of generated output in a webserver
* FIXED:    Namespaces where not included in the extend and implement xml nodes
* FIXED:    Class hierarchy chart entered an endless recursion if a class extended another class with the same name in a different namespace
* FIXED:    Closures break the parser, DocBlox_Reflection_Function::findName assumes to find one but closures do not have a name. Closures receive the name 'Closure'
* ADDED:    Line numbers to all objects in the xml output
* ADDED:    Add links to other classes with the @param and @return annotation information
* FIXED:    Namespace support was not converting local class notation to a full_name class notation (including namespaces)
* FIXED:    Namespace was not registered with anything else other than a file, class or interface
* ADDED:    Property @var tag also links to other files
* ADDED:    AJAX search box for larger projects, use the option '--search=Ajax' with the transformer to use it
* ADDED:    NONE search option to disable the search action, use the option '--search=None' with the transformer to use it
* ADDED:    New theme
* FIXED:    Theming did not support different XSL files per theme. this has now been fixed
* BC-BREAK: Namespaces and their sub-spaces are now stored hierarchically at the bottom of the XML file, this used to
            be a flat list
* ADDED:    Themes can now preprocess XSL templates present in the 'preprocess' folder and store them in memory to
            speed up parsing of seldom changing data
* FIXED:    variables in methods were recognized as properties when enclosed in accolades (thanks for noticing @pmjones)
* FIXED:    Improved performance by changing hash from md5 to filemtime (thanks to @pmjones for this tip!)
* ADDED:    Recognition of file character encoding and conversion to UTF-8 (thanks to @dzuelke)
* FIXED:    Improved performance by disabling the PHP Lint check by default; can be enabled using the --validate option
* ADDED:    Make packages foldable as i done with namespaces (no support for subpackages yet!) (thanks to @pmjones)
* FIXED:    Support for Unicode characters in @author annotations
* FIXED:    The generation of filenames for the transformation process produced the wrong names on Windows. A '/' was
            hardcoded while this should have been a DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR
* ADDED:    Version to parsed data (structure.xml) and enforce a full re-parse when the version number has changed
* BC-BREAK: Packages and subpackages are now stored hierarchically at the bottom of the XML file, this used to
            be a flat list
* ADDED:    Added support for the @subpackage in the sidebar of the default2 theme
* FIXED:    Renamed default2 template to default template
* ADDED:    Added search capabilities to default template (does not work in Chrome when running locally)
